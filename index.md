## About me

Hi! I am from Vietnam. Currently, I am a first-year Master student at International Graduate School of Artficial Intelligence, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), fortunate to be under the joint supervision of Prof. [Chang Kuei-Chung](https://iai.yuntech.edu.tw/academic_staff/changkc) and Prof. [Bo Hsiao](https://www.mis.yuntech.edu.tw/?page_id=26336).  

Previously, I graduated in Information Technology from University of Information Technology - Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (UIT - VNUHCM), where I excelled in the High Quality Program in Information Technology (Japanese-oriented).

My research interests broadly lie in **Management Information System**, at the intersection of Machine Learning **(ML)**, Deep Learning **(DL)**, Computational Linguistics **(CL)**, and Information System **(IS)** including:
* **(ML/DL & CL)**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Analytics, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
* **Information System (IS)**: Information Systems and Behavior, Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM).

Feel free to reach out! I enjoy connecting and discussing ideas across a wide range of topics. I’m always open to collaboration, so don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’re excited about these areas and interested in working together.
