## About me

Hi! I am from Vietnam. Currently, I am a first-year Master student at International Graduate School of Artficial Intelligence, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology (YunTech), fortunate to be under the joint supervision of Prof. [Chang Kuei-Chung](https://iai.yuntech.edu.tw/academic_staff/changkc) and Prof. [Bo Hsiao] (https://www.mis.yuntech.edu.tw/?page_id=26336).  

Previously, I graduated in Information Technology from University of Information Technology - Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (UIT - VNUHCM), where I excelled in the High Quality Program in Information Technology (Japanese-oriented).

My research interests broadly lie in **Management Information System**, at the intersection of machine learnin **(ML)**, natural language processing **(NLP)**, and information system **(IS)** including:
* **(ML&CV)** Learning with Imperfect & Limited Annotation: Label Scarcity, Domain Shift, Imbalanced Subpopulation Distribution, Unsupervised and Representation learning, Uncertainty Quantification.
* Fundamental **(MIC)**: Medical Image Segmentation/Reconstruction/Registration, Foundation Models in Medical Imaging, Learning with Multi-modality data, Integration of Imaging and Clinical data.

Feel free to reach out! I enjoy connecting and discussing ideas across a wide range of topics. I’m always open to collaboration, so don’t hesitate to get in touch if you’re excited about these areas and interested in working together.
